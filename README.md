my personal dotfiles

# installing
once cloned, exec `init.sh`

# editing
To add a dotfile to this repo, first add a symbolic link to `init.sh` and then edit the gitignore to enable tracking the file. The gitignore is structured as an "allow list"

After initial install the `recfg` alias can be used to reconfigure the local environment
